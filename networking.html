<p/>
The CCI project is an open-source communication interface that aims to
provide a simple and portable API, high performance, scalability for
the largest deployments, and robustness in the presence of faults. It
is developed and maintained by a partnership of research, academic,
and industry members.

<p/>
Targeted towards high performance computing (HPC) environments as well
as large data centers, CCI can provide a common network abstraction
layer (NAL) for persistent services as well as general interprocess
communication. In HPC, MPI is the de facto standard for communication
within a job. Persistent services such as distributed file systems,
code coupling (e.g. a simulation sending output to an analysis
application sending its output to a visualization process), health
monitoring, debugging, and performance monitoring, however, exist
outside of scheduler jobs or span multiple jobs. In these cases, these
persistent services tend to use either BSD sockets for portability to
avoid having to rewrite the applications for each new interconnect or
they implement their own NAL which takes developer time and effort.
CCI can simplify support for these persistent services by providing a
common NAL which minimizes the maintenance and support for these
services while providing improved performance (i.e. reduced latency
and increased bandwidth) compared to Sockets.

<p/>
We are currently working on proof-of-concept implementations using
Sockets (UDP), Cray Portals 3.3, OpenFabrics Verbs, Cray GNI, and IBM
BG/P (Kittyhawk), as well as raw Ethernet. Visit

information.
