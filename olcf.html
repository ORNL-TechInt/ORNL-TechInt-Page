<p/>The Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) was established
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2004 with the mission of standing
up a supercomputer 100 times more powerful than the leading systems of
the day.

<p/>The Technology Integration group was instrumental in designing and
implementing the infrastructure required to deliver Jaguar four years
later, in 2008. TechInt...
<ul>
  <li/>designed the Lustre-based "Spider" file system.

  <li/>improved Lustre so it would meet the Center's needs through
  feedback to the developers as well as by developing and submitting
  patches.

  <li/>developed intelligent network routing strategies.

  <li/>contributed to the design, development, deployment, and ongoing
  maintenance of the High Performance Storage System (HPSS), the
  OLCF's archival storage solution.
</ul>

<p/>Current Technology Integration projects in support of the OLCF
mission include projects to identify optimal strategies for allocating
resources on multi-core systems, improve I/O performance by
coordinating transfers so they don't interfere with each other,
understand how non-volatile memory can be used to enhance
computational performance, design and develop a generic high
performance network communication interface to simplify network
programming, and maintain and enhance High Performance Storage System (HPSS).

<p/>Looking forward, TechInt is working to identify, refine, and
deploy the storage and networking solutions required to operate
increasingly fast supercomputers, from 20 petaflops in 2012 to an exaflop
by the end of the decade (2018).
