<h2><a href="http://www.ccs.ornl.gov/~vazhkuda" target="_">Sudharshan Vazhkudai</a></h2>

<p />Sudharshan is the Group Leader of the Technology Integration
group in the National Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS) at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). NCCS hosts the multi-petaflop Titan
supercomputer.

<p />Prior to that, Sudharshan was a Research Scientist in the
Computer Science Research group of the 
<a href="http://www.csm.ornl.gov" target="_">Computer Science and
Mathematics Division</a> at ORNL, for over nine years. He joined ORNL in
August 2003. In this role, his work had straddled both basic and
applied distributed systems research. On the applied side of things, he
worked on building a distributed computing/data management solution
for the DOE's 
<a href="http://neutrons.ornl.gov/" target="_">Spallation Neutron
  Source</a>. 
From a basic research
standpoint, his focus has been on HPC I/O, storage systems and
multicore architectures.

<p />Sudharshan received a Ph.D. and Masters in Computer Science from
the 
<a href="http://www.olemiss.edu" target="_">University of Mississippi</a> in
2003 and 1998 respectively. His doctoral work (partly at 
<a href="http://www.anl.gov" target="_">Argonne
National Laboratory</a>, in Chicago, on a Wallace Givens Fellowship and a
Dissertation Fellowship) addressed data access issues in the 
<a href="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/2.4/datagrid/"
target="_">Globus Data Grid</a> environment. In what appears to be a
previous life (if you believe in that sort of a thing :)), Sudharshan
obtained a bachelors degree in computer science from 
<a href="http://www.kud.ac.in/" target="_">Karnatak University</a>
in India in 1996. He grew up in Madras, South India.
