<h2><a href="http://www.ccs.ornl.gov/~vazhkuda" target="_">Sudharshan Vazhkudai</a></h2>

<p />Sudharshan is the Group Leader of the Technology Integration
group in the National Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS) at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). NCCS hosts the multi-petaflop Titan
supercomputer.

<p />Prior to that, Sudharshan was a Research Scientist in the
Computer Science Research group of the Computer Science and
Mathematics Division at ORNL, for over nine years. He joined ORNL in
August 2003. In this role, his work had straddled both basic and
applied distributed systems research. On the applied side of things, he
worked on building a distributed computing/data management solution
for the DOE's Spallation Neutron Source. From a basic research
standpoint, his focus has been on HPC I/O, storage systems and
multicore architectures.

<p />Sudharshan received a Ph.D. and Masters in Computer Science from
the University of Mississippi in 2003 and 1998 respectively. His
doctoral work (partly at Argonne National Laboratory, in Chicago, on a
Wallace Givens Fellowship and a Dissertation Fellowship) addressed
data access issues in the Globus Data Grid environment. In what
appears to be a previous life (if you believe in that sort of a thing
:)), Sudharshan obtained a bachelors degree in computer science from
Karnatak University in India in 1996. He grew up in Madras, South
India.
