<h2><a href="http://www.ccs.ornl.gov/~vazhkuda" target="_">Sudharshan Vazhkudai</a></h2>

<p />I am the Group Leader of the Technology Integration group in the
National Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS) at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory (ORNL). NCCS hosts the multi-petaflop Titan
supercomputer.

<p />Prior to that, I was a Research Scientist in the Computer Science
Research group of the Computer Science and Mathematics Division at
ORNL, for over nine years. I joined ORNL in August 2003. In this role,
my work had straddled both basic and applied distributed systems
research. On the applied side of things, I worked on building a
distributed computing/data management solution for the DOE's
Spallation Neutron Source. From a basic research standpoint, my focus
has been on HPC I/O, storage systems and multicore architectures.

<p />I received a Ph.D. and Masters in Computer Science from the
University of Mississippi in 2003 and 1998 respectively. My doctoral
work (partly at Argonne National Laboratory, in Chicago, where I was
on a Wallace Givens Fellowship and a Dissertation Fellowship)
addressed data access issues in the Globus Data Grid environment. In
what appears to be my previous life (if you believe in that sort of a
thing :)), obtained a bachelors degree in computer science from
Karnatak University in India in 1996. I grew up in Madras, South
India.
