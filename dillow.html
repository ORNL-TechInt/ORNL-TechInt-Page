<h2>David Dillow</h2>

<p/>Dave Dillow is an Advanced Systems Architect and Developer at
the National Center for Computational Sciences located at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory. He joined NCCS in 2007 to deploy the first
large-scale, routed Lustre file system, and he currently co-chairs
Open Scalable File Systems Technology Working Group. His research
combines his interest in operating systems, parallel computing, and
high- performance networks and storage to design systems for future
supercomputers.

<p/>During the deployment of <a href="storage.html#Spider">Spider</a>, Dave designed the network
infrastructure and developed the fine-grained routing framework that
allowed the file system to overcome network congestion and provide
better end-user performance, meeting the project performance goals.
Dave works on the team enhancing OLCF file systems to support future
generations of our leadership computing platforms.

<p/>Recent work includes, an implementation of CCI embeded in the
SeaStar firmware called <a href="networking.html#DStar">DStar</a>,
which provides about half the latency of the vendor-provided network
stack.

<p/>Dave has been one of lead developers
on <a href="data.html#ADARA">ADARA</a>, a project to improve real time
data acquisition at the Spallation Neutron Source allowing more
efficient and effective use of the facility.

<p/>Dave is also working with several other group members on an LDRD
project called <a href="storage.html#SOS">Scalable Object Store</a> (SOS), which investigates
innovative mechanisms for future storage systems that will scale to
extreme capacity and bandwidth.
