     Systems Programmer. Since coming to ORNL in 2000, Tom has 
     administered systems, written software on the HPSS project,
     and most recently worked on data publication in the Earth System
     Grid project. He received a B.S. in Computer Science from
     Vanderbilt University in 1982 and an M.S. in Software Engineering
     from University of Maryland in 2007. For HPSS, he has contributed
     to the Storage System Manager subsystem and currently owns and
     manages the Logging subsystem. In support of scientific data
     publication in ESG and other venues, he is currently working on a
     data publication tool called EZ-Pub.

     degree from KAIST in 2003 and a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science
     and Engineering from Pennsylvania State University in 2009. His
     research interests include operating systems, parallel I/O and
     file systems, storage systems, emerging storage technologies, and
     performance evaluation. His current research projects include (i)
     NVMalloc libraries offering extended memory partitions using
     NVRAM devices for applications, (ii) a large-scale Flash-based
     storage system, (iii) efficient I/O scheduling algorithms for
     parallel file systems, and (iv) Active Flash that enables
     out-of-core computation on NVRAM devices. He is currently an
     adjunct professor in the School of Electrical and Computer
     Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology.
