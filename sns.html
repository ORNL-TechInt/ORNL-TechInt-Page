SNS is a one-of-a-kind research facility that provides the most
intense pulsed neutron beams in the world for scientific research and
industrial development. SNS produces neutrons with an
accelerator-based system that delivers short (microsecond) proton
pulses to a target/moderator system, where neutrons are produced by a
process called spallation. State-of-the-art experiment stations
provide a variety of capabilities for researchers across a broad range
of disciplines, such as physics, chemistry, materials science, and biology.

<p/>
Members of the TechInt group have provided data acquisition support to
SNS since around 2004, beginning with Sudharshan's work developing
their distributed computing/data management solution.

<p/>
More recently, other group members have been involved with upgrading
and enhancing SNS' data acquisition equipment and software through the
Accelerating Data Acquisition, Reduction, and Analysis (ADARA) project.
