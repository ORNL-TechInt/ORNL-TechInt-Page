<h2>Devesh Tiwari</h2>

<p>Devesh is a Research Scientist - Computer Systems Architect in the
Technology Integration group in the <a href="National Center for Computational
Sciences" target="other"> http://www.nccs.gov/</a> at <a href="Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory (ORNL)" target="other"> http://www.ornl.gov/</a>.  He is passionate about
making large-scale computing systems more energy efficient while expediting the
process of scientific discovery. </p>

<p>Devesh is broadly interested in computer systems performance/energy
modeling and analysis. He enthusiastically works on developing novel
techniques and deploying useful tools that improve the
energy-efficiency and resilience of these large-scale systems. </p>

<p>Devesh <a href="led the Active Flash" target="other">
https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast13/active-flash-towards-energy-efficient-situ-data-analytics-extreme-scale-machines</a>
project that makes a case for
energy-efficient in-situ scientific data analysis on SSD
controllers. Active Flash project is being extended to
build analysis-aware file systems and include new
scheduling mechanisms  to reduce data-movement across
multiple SSDs.</p>


<p>Devesh has published his research at various
publication venues, including USENIX FAST,
HotPower, IPDPS, HPCA and ISPASS. One of his
papers was nominated for the best paper award at
IPDPS 2012, and received best talk award at
IBMâ€™s Student Workshop on Frontiers of Cloud
Computing organized by IBM Thomas J. Watson
research center. He has also spent brief
research stints at <a href="National University of
Singapore" target="other"> http://www.nus.edu.sg/</a> and <a href="Seoul National University,
South Korea" target="other"> http://www.useoul.edu/</a>.</p>

<p>Devesh has also served on technical program committees of various
conferences
including IPDPS, ICDCS, ISPASS and CCGrid, and organized a BoF session at
SOSP.</p>

<p>Devesh received a PhD degree in Computer Engineering from <a href="North
Carolina State University" target="other"> http://www.ncsu.edu/</a> and a bachelors degree in
Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="IIT Kanpur" target="other">
http://www.iitk.ac.in/</a>,
India.  Devesh was born in <a href="Allahabad, UP, India" target="other">
