<p>DRAM is a precious resource in extreme-scale machines and is
increasingly becoming scarce, mainly due to the growing number of
cores per node. On future multi-petaflop and exaflop machines, the
memory pressure is likely to be so severe that we need to rethink our
memory usage models. Fortunately, the advent of non-volatile memory
(NVM) offers a unique opportunity in this space. Current NVM offerings
possess several desirable properties, such as low cost and power
efficiency, but also suffer from high latency and lifetime issues. We
need rich techniques to be able to use them alongside DRAM. NVMalloc
is an approach for exploiting NVM as a secondary memory partition so
that applications can explicitly allocate and manipulate memory
regions therein. More specifically, it is a middleware library with a
suite of services that enables applications to access node-local or
distributed NVM storage system in a seamless fashion.
