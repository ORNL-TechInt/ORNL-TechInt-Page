<h2>About the ORNL Technology Integration Group</h2>

<p/>
Technology Integration (TechInt) Group staff work behind the scenes to
develop the infrastructure that supports the NCCS systems and keep it
ahead of the technology curve. They research and evaluate emerging
technologies in areas such as networks, file systems, and archival
storage and provide the system programming to seamlessly integrate
technologies and tools into the infrastructure as they are adopted. In
conjunction with personnel from other Labs and IBM, TechInt staff also
contributes to the design and development of the High-Performance
Storage System, used to maintain the NCCS' massive data archive.

<p/>
TechInt is responsible for continuing to expand the NCCS wide area
network to increase the speed of data transfer and for implementing
cybersecurity measures for the network. The group was also responsible
for putting the new Lustre file system into place. As NCCS systems
continue to scale up, the TechInt team is focusing on developing tools
(e.g., compilers, debuggers, and performance analysis) that enable
users to take full advantage of the expanded capabilities of the
leadership class systems.
