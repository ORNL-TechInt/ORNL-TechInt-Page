<h2>About the ORNL Technology Integration Group</h2>

<p>
The Technology Integration (TechInt) group is charged with delivering
new technologies into the Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) and
other projects at ORNL by identifying gaps in the system software
stack and working with the R&D community to develop, harden, and
deploy solutions. Their technology scope includes archival storage,
parallel file systems, data management, high-performance networking,
and architecture. TechInt staff work behind the scenes to develop the
infrastructure that supports the NCCS systems and keep it ahead of the
technology curve. They research and evaluate emerging technologies in
the aforementioned areas and provide the systems programming to
seamlessly integrate technologies and tools into the infrastructure as
they are adopted.
