<h2><a href="http://users.nccs.gov/~yk7/index.html" target="_">Youngjae Kim</a></h2>

<p/>Youngjae is a Research and Development Staff Member at US Department
of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory and works as an I/O Systems
Computational Scientist for the National Center for Computational
Sciences. 

<p/>Youngjae's research interests include operating systems, parallel I/O
and file systems, storage systems, emerging storage technologies, and
performance evaluation. His current research projects include (i)
NVMalloc libraries offering extended memory partitions using NVRAM
devices for applications, (ii) a large-scale Flash-based storage
system, (iii) efficient I/O scheduling algorithms for parallel file
systems, and (iv) Active Flash that enables out-of-core computation on
NVRAM devices. 

<p/>Youngjae received his B.S. degree in Computer Science from 
<a href="http://www.sogang.ac.kr/english/" target="_">Sogang
University</a>, Korea in 2001, M.S. degree
from <a href="http://www.kaist.edu" target="_">KAIST</a> in 2003 and
Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from
<a href="http://www.psu.edu" target="_">Pennsylvania
State University</a> in 2009. Youngjae is also an adjunct professor in the
<a href="http://www.ece.gatech.edu/" target="_">School of Electrical
