<b>Youngjae Kim</b>

<p>Youngjae is a Research and Development Staff Member at
     US Department of Energyâ€™s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and works
     as an I/O Systems Computational Scientist for the National Center
     for Computational Sciences. He received his B.S. degree in
     Computer Science from Sogang University, Korea in 2001, his M.S.
     degree from KAIST in 2003 and a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science
     and Engineering from Pennsylvania State University in 2009. His
     research interests include operating systems, parallel I/O and
     file systems, storage systems, emerging storage technologies, and
     performance evaluation. His current research projects include (i)
     NVMalloc libraries offering extended memory partitions using
     NVRAM devices for applications, (ii) a large-scale Flash-based
     storage system, (iii) efficient I/O scheduling algorithms for
     parallel file systems, and (iv) Active Flash that enables
     out-of-core computation on NVRAM devices. He is currently an
     adjunct professor in the School of Electrical and Computer
     Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology.
